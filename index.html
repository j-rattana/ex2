      I don't <em>understand</em> my feelings <br> 
      I really don't <br> 
      I don't <em>understand</em> how I could <strong>hate</strong> you <br> 
      So <em>much</em> after all this time <br> 
      How no matter how much I'd like to not hate you <br> 
      I hate you even <em>more</em> it <strong>grows</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't even see you now <br> 
      All I see is this picture of <strong>you, you and her</strong> <br> 
      I don't even know if this picture's real anymore <br>
      I don't even <em>care</em>, it's a made-up picture <br>
      It <strong>invades</strong> my head, <strong>the two of you</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      And this picture it stings me more than <br>
      If I'd actually seen you with her, <strong>it cuts me <br>
      It cuts me so <em>deep</em> I'll never get over it</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      And <em>I can't get rid</em> of this picture either <br>
      It just <strong>comes <em>uninvited</em></strong> <br>
      Kind of like a little <em>torture</em> <br>
      And I blame <strong>you</strong> more for this little torture <br>
      Than I do for what <strong><em>you did</em></strong>
