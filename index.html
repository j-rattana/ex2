      I don't <em>understand</em> my feelings <br> 
      I really don't <br> 
      I don't <em>understand</em> how I could <strong>hate</strong> you <br> 
      So <em>much</em> after all this time <br> 
      How no matter how much I'd like to not hate you <br> 
      I hate you even <em>more</em> it <strong>grows</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't even see you now <br> 
      All I see is this picture of you, you and her <br> 
      I don't even know if this picture's real anymore <br>
      I don't even care, it's a made-up picture <br>
      It invades my head, the two of you
    </p>
    <p>
      And this picture it stings me more than <br>
      If I'd actually seen you with her, it cuts me <br>
      It cuts me so deep I'll never get over it
    </p>
    <p>
      And I can't get rid of this picture either <br>
      It just comes uninvited <br>
      Kind of like a little torture <br>
      And I blame you more for this little torture <br>
      Than I do for what you did
