    <p>
      I don't understand my feelings <br> 
      I really don't <br> 
      I don't understand how I could hate you <br> 
      So much after all this time <br> 
      How no matter how much I'd like to not hate you <br> 
      I hate you even more it grows
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't even see you now <br> 
      All I see is this picture of you, you and her <br> 
      I don't even know if this picture's real anymore <br>
      I don't even care, it's a made-up picture <br>
      It invades my head, the two of you
